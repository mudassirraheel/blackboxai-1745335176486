# User Workspace

## Project Overview

User Workspace is a simple web application that generates unique tracking links using Node.js and the Express framework. Each link leads to a tracking page, and this functionality is intended for demonstration purposes.

## Installation

To install the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd user-workspace
   ```

2. Install the dependencies using npm:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

The application will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

To generate a unique tracking link, navigate to the following endpoint in your web browser:

```
http://localhost:3000/generate-link
```

This endpoint will return a JSON response containing the unique link. You can then visit the link to access the tracking page.

## Features

- **Unique Link Generation**: Generate unique tracking links using UUID.
- **Tracking Page**: Users can access a tracking page if they use a valid link.
- **In-memory Storage**: Links are stored in memory using a Set for demonstration purposes.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following dependencies:

- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js.
- **UUID**: A library for generating unique IDs.

You can find these dependencies in the `package.json` file:

```json
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^5.1.0",
  "uuid": "^11.1.0"
}
```

## Project Structure

Here's a brief overview of the project structure:

```
user-workspace/
├── package.json          # Project metadata and dependencies
├── package-lock.json     # Dependency tree
├── server.js             # Main server file
└── public/               # Directory containing static files (e.g., HTML)
    └── track.html        # Tracking page HTML
```

- **server.js**: This is the main entry point for the application where the Express app is set up, and the routes are defined.
- **public/**: Contains static files to serve, including the `track.html` file which is shown when a valid tracking link is accessed.
